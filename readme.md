# Macro Remapping Software

## Overview

This project was born out of the frustration with the limitations and missing features of existing gaming software from brands like Logitech, Corsair, and Cougar. While these brands offer high-quality gaming hardware, their respective software tools have significant limitations, making it difficult to create a truly seamless and customizable gaming experience. This software aims to fill those gaps by providing a versatile, high-performance solution to remap keys, profiles, macros, and more, working across multiple devices.

## Limitations

While the software provides many features, there are some current limitations due to the lack of detailed driver information for specific devices and brands:

- **Extra Mouse Buttons**: Currently unable to detect raw input for extra buttons beyond button 5, such as those found in the G502 or other mice with additional buttons.
- **Keyboard Inputs**: Similar limitations with keyboard keys for remapping.
- **RGB Control**: RGB control features are not yet supported due to limited access to RGB data across different devices.

## Features

### Existing Features:

- **Temporal Profile Shift**: Easily switch between multiple profiles based on holding a key.
- **Any Key Remap**: Remap any key on your keyboard or mouse to another function.
- **Cross-Device Harmony**: Use multiple devices from different brands in harmony to handle macros.
- **Simple Macros**: Create simple macros for various commands and actions.
- **Repeat While Holding Macro**: Trigger macros that repeat as long as a key is held down.
- **Toggle Macro**: Set macros to toggle on or off with a single keypress.
- **Run Program**: Set macros to launch programs or applications.
- **Scroll Remapping**: Remap the scroll wheel to any action, enhancing its functionality.
- **Active Window Detection**: Automatically adjust macros based on the active window.
- **Profile Stacking**: Create a child profile from an existing profile, allowing for selective remapping while maintaining the rest of the actions.

### Backlog Features:

- **Toggle Hold Keypress**: A toggle feature to hold key presses, useful for walking in FPS games, and applicable to various applications.
- **MIDI Input Remap**: Remap MIDI inputs, which can be helpful for musicians or sound designers.
- **Profile Switching**: Switch between profiles based on certain triggers or conditions.

### Workaround:

As a workaround, extra buttons are remapped to keys in the F13-F24 range, allowing for up to 12 additional key inputs. Less commonly used keys like Scroll Lock and Pause can also be repurposed to expand the pool of available key presses.

## Current Setup

The software is designed to work seamlessly with a variety of devices. Currently, it integrates flawlessly with the following hardware:

- **Logitech G502 Mouse**: Provides high customization, despite its limitations with Logitech's software.
- **Corsair K100 Keyboard**: Known for its excellent build quality and features, but limited in integration with non-Corsair devices.
- **Ikkegol Triple Foot Pedal**: Adds another level of versatility for gaming and productivity.

Together, these devices are fully supported, ensuring a smooth experience across gaming and productivity applications.

## Why This Project?

As a long-time user of multiple gaming brands, I found that each gaming brand had some form of limitation in its software or hardware. For example:

- **Logitech**: While their G502 mouse is highly rated, their software only supports a single profile shift and lacks advanced features like scroll remapping.
- **Corsair**: Offers top-tier hardware but fails to support scroll remapping and lacks availability of some mouse models in certain regions.
- **Cougar**: Provides some of the most complete software, especially with scroll remapping, but their availability and product variety is limited in certain regions.

This software bridges those gaps by providing a unified solution that works across all these devices, giving users the features they need without being locked into a single brand ecosystem.
